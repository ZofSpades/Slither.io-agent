## üéØ Overview

This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent capable of playing Slither.io, a popular multiplayer online game. Since OpenAI Universe is deprecated, we've created a custom Slither.io-like environment that simulates the game mechanics, allowing the agent to learn through interaction.

**Key Highlights:**
- Custom Slither.io environment with realistic game mechanics
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation with PyTorch
- Experience replay buffer for stable learning
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Comprehensive visualization and evaluation metrics
- Support for both Double DQN and Dueling DQN architectures

## ‚ú® Features

- üéÆ **Custom Game Environment**: Simulated Slither.io environment with snake movement, food collection, and collision detection
- üß† **Deep Q-Network**: CNN-based architecture for processing raw pixel inputs
- üíæ **Experience Replay**: Memory buffer for storing and sampling past experiences
- üìä **Real-time Visualization**: Training progress monitoring with matplotlib
- üéØ **Multiple Training Modes**: Support for standard DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN
- üìà **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation including survival time, score, and win rate
- üé• **Gameplay Recording**: Generate videos of agent gameplay

## üìù Problem Statement

**Objective:** Train a reinforcement learning agent to play Slither.io by processing raw image frames and outputting optimal action commands.

**Input:** Raw pixel frames (84x84 grayscale images)

**Output:** Discrete actions (left, right, straight, speed burst)

**Goals:**
- Maximize agent survival time
- Maximize snake length/score
- Achieve better performance than random baseline policy

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Average episode score
- Survival time
- Win rate vs baseline
- Score improvement over random policy

  - 84x84 grayscale frames
  - Normalized pixel values [0, 1]
```

Or use VS Code with Jupyter extension

2. **Execute cells sequentially**
   - Run all cells using "Restart & Run All" or
   - Execute cells one by one to see intermediate results

3. **Training the agent**
   - The notebook includes pre-configured hyperparameters
   - Training runs for 500 episodes by default
   - Progress is displayed with tqdm progress bars

4. **Viewing results**
   - Training plots are generated automatically
   - Evaluation metrics are displayed in the notebook

### Quick Start Example

```python
# Initialize environment and agent
env = SlitherIOEnv(grid_size=84, max_steps=1000)
agent = DQNAgent(state_size=84*84, action_size=4, seed=42)

# Train the agent
scores = train_dqn(agent, env, n_episodes=500)

# Evaluate performance
test_agent(agent, env, n_episodes=100)
```

## üî¨ Model Details

### Hyperparameters

```python
BUFFER_SIZE = 100000      # Replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 64           # Minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99              # Discount factor
TAU = 1e-3                # Soft update parameter
LR = 5e-4                 # Learning rate
UPDATE_EVERY = 4          # Network update frequency
TARGET_UPDATE = 1000      # Target network update frequency
```

### Exploration Strategy

- **Epsilon-Greedy**: Balances exploration and exploitation
- **Initial Œµ**: 1.0 (fully random)
- **Final Œµ**: 0.01 (mostly exploitation)
- **Decay**: Linear or exponential decay over episodes

### Reward Structure

```python
Rewards:
  +10  : Food collected (snake grows)
  +1   : Survival (each step)
  -100 : Collision/death
  +0.1 : Moving toward food (shaped reward)
```

## üèãÔ∏è Training Process

### Training Configuration

- **Episodes**: 500-1000 episodes
- **Max Steps per Episode**: 1000
- **Training Time**: ~2-4 hours on CPU, ~30-60 min on GPU
- **Convergence**: Typically converges after 200-300 episodes

### Training Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Episodes 0-100)**: Random exploration, high loss
2. **Phase 2 (Episodes 100-300)**: Learning patterns, improving performance
3. **Phase 3 (Episodes 300+)**: Refined strategy, stable performance

### Monitoring Training

The notebook provides real-time visualization:
- Episode scores over time
- Moving average rewards
- Loss curves
- Epsilon decay
- Survival time trends
